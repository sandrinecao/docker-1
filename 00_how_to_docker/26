#Launch a 42school/engineering-bay service in two replicas and make sure that
#the service works properly. This service will be named engineering-bay and
#will be on the overmind network.

docker service create -d --network overmind --name engineering-bay --replicas 2 -e OC_USERNAME=root -e OC_PASSWD=root 42school/engineering-bay

#Same approach as problem 24, and also use the docker service ls to check
