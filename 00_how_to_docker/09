#From the shell of a debian container, install via the container's package manager
#everything you need to compile C source code and push it onto a git repo (of
#course, make sure before that the package manager and the packages already in the
#container are updated). For this exercise, you should only specify the commands
#to be run directly in the container.

apt-get update
apt-get upgrade -y
apt-get install -y build-essential git vim

#to open the debian container, it's like with the previous exercise.
#use: docker run -it --rm debian /bin/sh
